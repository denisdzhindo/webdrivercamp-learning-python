2. Now make it dynamic
Modify the XPath from task #1 to make it dynamic:
So we can select a specific section based on the header of the section
//some_xpath..."Brand" - would point to Brand section
//same_xpath..."Color" - would point to Brand section

3. Add the checkboxes
Modify the XPath from task #2 to select specific checkboxes of the specific section
//some_xpath..."Brand"..."adidas" - would point to Brand section to checkbox named adidas
//same_xpath..."Color"..."Blue" - would point to Color section to checkbox named blue
