What are sets and how to use them 

Sets are collections of unique objects. Sets hold unique individual elements (not key-value pairs) in an unordered fashion. 
One important note about setas is that they are not ordered, so iterating through a set is not guaranteed to give you the same result every time.
In Python you can create a new set with my_set = set() function, add to it my_set.add(item), and remove from with my_set.remove(item).
